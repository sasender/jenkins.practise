Jenkins Installation
Introduction
In this hands-on lab, we will install Java and Jenkins. Once this is done and the Jenkins instance is up and running, take some time to look around the interface and ensure you are familiar with all the menu items and other parts of the interface.

Solution
Log in to the server using the credentials provided:

ssh cloud_user@<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>
Install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel and EPL repo
Install Java:

sudo yum install -y epel-release java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel
Install the Repo and Key, and Then Install Jenkins
Install wget:

sudo yum install -y wget
Download the repo:

sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.repo
Import the required key:

sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.io.key
Install Jenkins:

sudo yum install -y jenkins
Enable Jenkins:

sudo systemctl enable jenkins
Start Jenkins:

sudo systemctl start jenkins
In a new browser tab, navigate to http://<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>:8080, replacing <PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS> with the IP address of the cloud server provided on the lab page.

We'll be taken to an Unlock Jenkins page telling us we need to locate the password. In the terminal, run:

sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
Copy the result of the command, as this is the password we need.

Paste the password into the Administrator password field on the Jenkins browser page.

Click Continue.

Click Install suggested plugins. Note: If the install of any plugins fails, just wait a moment and click retry.

On the new user creation page, set the following values:

Username: student
Password: OmgPassword!
Full name: student
E-mail address: student\@acloudguru.com
Click Save and Continue.

Click Save and Finish.

Click Start using Jenkins.

Click Manage Jenkins in the left-hand menu, and then look around a bit to get familiar with the items in that area.

Conclusion
Congratulations on successfully completing this hands-on lab!
